 					<p>I am a software developer currently higly addicted to Ruby on Rails. I am happily (soon-to-be) married to my wonderful wife April and we have a dog named Jackson. Born and raised in Yugoslavia, I now call Colorado home. After relocating to USA and graduating from college with Bachelors of Computer Information Systems whole new realm of opportunities opened to me. I have been exposed to both technical and business aspects of problem solving and I enjoy capturing the gist of the clients' needs and providing them the most viable solutions that will fit their business operations perfectly. I'm interested in everything that improves the productivity of software developers the quality of the applications we create.</p>
 					<p>Little bit more about me. I felt in love with software development since early age. My first exposure to wonderful world of programming was with BASIC on my legendary Commodore 64. I was 5 at the time, but the bond that formed was unbreakable and back then I knew that software development will be my true calling. Upon graduating from college I started working for a software development company in Michigan, develiping web based solutions for variety of clients (from medical, and automotive industry to academic clients and local businesses).</p>				
 				<p> On the link below you can check out my portfolio with some of the projects I have been involved with:

 				<p>I discovered Ruby on Rails in 2006 and since then it has become my tool of choice. It is an open source web framework maximizing your webapp functionality while minimizing the time needed to implement it. In last 5 years I've built numberous web applications with it and each new project Rails surprises me more and more. I've learend the true meaning of agile development since the clients requests are not often set in stone and they often change throughout the development cycle of the project. I observed, analyzed and resolved numerous processes and successfully translated them into business rules necessary for further project development.</p>
				<p>When I’m not busy having fun working for clients or developing my own projects, I spend time expanding my knowledge about new ways to improve my software development skills. Basically, I am always learning new things on the go and I like to challenge myself in every way. In the future I’d like to get more involved with volunteer work for community of Higlands Ranch, CO. I also like to get away from the geek world by fishing at the nearest lake, jogging, snow tubing on Rocky mountains, biking around my community, and spending time with my amazing wife.</p>
